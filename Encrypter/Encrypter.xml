            Encrypts a string by means of AES. The result gets base64 encoded.
            Due to the necessary millions of SHA512 iterations, the methods runs at least several seconds in the year 2020 (approx. 5-7s).
            This method suits for small data such as telegrams, JSON data, text notes, passwords, etc. For larger
            data, might use the stream overload. Rule of thumb: If the data could be stored three times in
            the present memory, this method could be used.
